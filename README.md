# AI-Powered Smart Irrigation Advisor ((Pragati AI For Impact 2025))

A system to optimize irrigation using AI, saving water and improving crop yields.

## Description

This project uses machine learning to provide personalized irrigation recommendations to farmers based on weather data, soil moisture sensor data, and crop characteristics.  It's designed to be a cost-effective and scalable solution for sustainable agriculture.

## Features

*   Real-time soil moisture monitoring
*   Weather data integration
*   AI-powered irrigation recommendations
*   User-friendly web/mobile interface (prototype)
*   Alerts for critical conditions (prototype)

## Technologies

*   Python
*   Scikit-learn
*   Flask 
*   React   

## Setup Instructions

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3.  Configure API keys (weather API, etc.).

## Usage

1.  Start the backend server.
2.  Start the frontend application.
3.  Access the application through your web browser.

## Datasets

*   Weather data: Publicly available weather APIs (e.g. OpenWeatherMap)
*   Soil Moisture Data: Synthetic data for initial testing. Real sensor data is intended in the future.
*   Crop and irrigation data: User-provided data, along with data from public resources.
